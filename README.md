**Server Patcher** patches exploits before Mojang does so you don't have to worry about it.

### Download

You can download the plugin by going to the latest release and download the jar file provided this plugin is currently only supported 1.17+ at this point in time but may be changed soon.

### Discord

You can join my discord using this invite https://discord.gg/Y59DddqZZR please join the server if you have any issues or suggestions that you would like to make do not make random issues when you could just use the discord

### Requirements

You must have ProtocolLib installed obviously for anything to work if you do not the sever will fail to start, you must also have a server above the version of 1.17 and Java 16+ or else it will fail because NMS likes changing things.
